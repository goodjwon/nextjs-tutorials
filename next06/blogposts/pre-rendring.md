## Title Description

When you work on multiple projects, and this happens quite often if you're into **Open Source** , you will find yourself in a situation where you need to use different Node.js versions but you're stuck.

A project might require a newer version, let's say higher than 18, while another old project might be bound to a lower version, let's say 16, due to some dependencies.

You can't just install the latest version of Node.js and use it for **all your projects** because you'll break the old ones. And you can't just install the old version and use it for all your projects because you'll break the new ones instead.

Is there an easy way to handle that? Sure there is, and it is called nvm. In the video here, I will show you how it works and how you can install this tool in your terminal. Works on all OS but make sure you install the right one. More details on the video, and later in the article.
